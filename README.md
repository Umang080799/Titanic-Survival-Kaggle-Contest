# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

I participated in the ongoing Kaggle Competetion and predicted with a 76.5% accuracy if a person will survive the iconic Titanic shipwreck. 

## I made it to the top 75% of the Kaggle leaderboard. 

The predictions were based on the basis of - 

1. Gender
2. Passenger Class
3. Age which I divided into Age Categories to increase the accuracy of my Logistic Regression model.  

## Environment and Tools

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Feature Engineering

## I look forward to contribute even further to the Kaggle Community.
